<h1>GUI based Matrix Calculator 💻 in Python 🐍</h1>
<h3>I searched for GUI based matrix calculator but didn't find any 😟, so decided to make on in Python using PyQt designer.</h3>
All you have to do is just download the code from here and extract it anywhere, after that install modules mentioned below!

<h2>Pre-requisite ✅</h2>
`pip install PyQt5`
<h2>How to start? 🤔</h2>
Open the folder, under that run the `main.py` file. It will run perfectly fine!
If you still see any error, please raise an issue in this repository.

<h1>Thank you 😊</h1>
